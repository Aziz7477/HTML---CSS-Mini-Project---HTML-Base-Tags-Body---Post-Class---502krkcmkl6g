This appears to be the source code for a website that showcases the photography work of a person named Aziz. The website has a homepage with a navigation bar that links to different sections of the website such as "Home," "Gallery," "About," and "Contact Us." The website also has three sections that showcase different types of photography, "Mountains," "Underwater," and "Nature." Each of these sections has a button that invites the user to view images of that category and has a brief description about the topic. The website also uses a CSS file called "styles.css" to control the layout and design of the webpage.
